A classic Minesweeper game implementation built with Python and pygame.

## Demo

## Description

This is a fully functional Minesweeper game featuring a 16x16 grid with 40 randomly placed mines. Players can reveal cells to find numbers indicating adjacent mines, or flag cells they suspect contain mines. The game includes hover effects, color-coded numbers, intuitive tool switching, flood-fill revealing, and complete win/lose functionality.

## Features

- **16x16 Game Board**: Classic minesweeper grid size with 40 mines
- **Dual Tool System**: Switch between mine detection and flag placement tools
- **Flood Fill Algorithm**: Automatically reveals connected empty areas when clicking empty cells
- **Game Over & Win Detection**: Complete game state management with proper win/lose conditions
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and color-coded number display
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Left-click to reveal cells, switch tools to flag suspicious areas
- **Color-Coded Numbers**: Each number (1-8) has a unique color to indicate the number of adjacent mines
- **Restart Functionality**: Press 'R' to restart the game after winning or losing
- **Custom Sprites**: Beautiful custom artwork for different cell states

## Screenshots

The game includes various visual states:
- Normal land tiles
- Highlighted tiles on hover
- Revealed empty tiles with numbers
- Flagged tiles
- Bomb tiles (when revealed)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pygame

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RadmehrVafadar/mine-sweeper 
cd mine-sweeper
```

2. Install pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run `python main.py` to launch the game window
2. **Tool Selection**: Click the tool button in the bottom-right corner to switch between:
   - **Bomb Tool** (default): Click to reveal cells
   - **Flag Tool**: Click to place/remove flags on suspected mine locations
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Click on cells to reveal them
   - Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell
   - Use flags to mark suspected mine locations
   - Avoid clicking on mines!

### Number Color Code

- **1**: Light Blue
- **2**: Green  
- **3**: Red
- **4**: Dark Blue
- **5**: Hot Pink
- **6**: Orange
- **7**: Yellow
- **8+**: Dark Pink

## Game Controls

- **Left Click**: Reveal cell (bomb tool) or place/remove flag (flag tool)
- **Tool Button**: Click to switch between bomb detection and flag placement
- **R Key**: Restart the game after game over or winning
- **Window Close**: Click the X button to exit

## Classes

### Button Class
Handles individual mine cells with states for:
- Normal, hover, clicked, flagged, bomb, and empty states
- Number display with color coding
- Event handling for mouse interactions

### ToggleButton Class
Manages the tool selection button:
- Toggles between bomb detection and flag placement tools
- Visual feedback showing current tool state
